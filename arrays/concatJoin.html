<body>
	<p>Simple example of Javascript's built in concat() and join() methods. The list below is built by concatenating two separate arrays before creating a string from the resulting combined array. The join() is passed a "&ltbr/&gt"
	element to place each array item on a new line.</p>

<script>
	var coreMembers = [ "Regine", "Jeremy", "Win", "Will", "Richard", "Tim" ];
	var auxMembers = [ "Sarah", "Owen", "Colin" ];

	var allMembers = coreMembers.concat(auxMembers);
	var memberString = allMembers.join("<br />");

	document.write(memberString);
